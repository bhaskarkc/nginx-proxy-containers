## NGINX proxy server for docker containers.

This is a simple nginx proxy server setup to map web apps running independently on separate containers.

![Image](proxy/nginx-proxy-containers.png  "Figure: Nginx Proxy server workflow.")

To setup the proxy server for you local apps just update `proxy/servers.json` file with respective settings.

```config
[
    {
        "site_a": {
            "server_name":"my-site-a",
            "location":"/"
        },
        "site_b": {
            "server_name":"my-site-b",
            "location":"/"
        }
    }
]
```

For instance, if we are running more than one web apps on docker containers then obviously, we will not be able to expose same external port for the app.

```config
for example:
- http://my-site-a/
- http://my-site-b/
```

By using, nginx proxy server we can request respective servers irrespective to the exposed port to host.

### Docker Network

Docker containers need to be in same network in order to identify each other. Therefore, we will have to create a bridge network and assign that network to every docker container we wish to put in the proxy network.

```sh
docker network create -d bridge nginx-proxy
```

Include, network config in docker compose file, for example:

```yaml
version: '3.5'
services:
 site_a:
  container_name: mysite_a
   image: nginx:alpine
   networks:
    - nginx-proxy
networks:
  nginx-proxy:
    name: nginx-proxy
```

### Test

Add hostnames entries in your host machine's `/etc/hosts` file.
```
127.0.0.1 my-site-a
127.0.0.1 my-site-b
```

This repo consists of a working proxy server and sample web app `site_a` and `site_b`.

Steps:

1. `docker-compose -f site-A/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` : Spin up `site_a` container.
2. `docker-compose -f site-B/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` : Spin up `site_b` container.
3. `docker-compose -f proxy/docker-compose.yml up --build -d` : Spins up the `the_proxy` container.


Curl request from host machine would look like below.

```config
âžœ curl -I my-site-a
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Sun, 27 Jan 2019 12:01:02 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 18
Connection: keep-alive
```

### NGINX config


#### [upstream directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#upstream)

```config
    upstream site_a { server site_a; }
```
or,
```config
    upstream site_a { server site_a:3000; }
    upstream site_b { server site_b:3000; }
```

Here `site_a` and `site_b` is name of the running docker containers and `3000` is the port exposed in that container.


### [server directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html#server)

### Typical proxy server config.

So, typical proxy server config looks like as below.

```config
upstream site_a { server site_a:3000; }
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name my-site-a;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://site_a;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}

upstream site_b { server site_b:3000; }
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name my-site-b;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://site_b;
        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```
